          <h3>The recent crypto bull market behind the alt data set</h3>
          <p>2021-03-27</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article_content">
          <p>In fact, when you look at other traditional commodities such as gold, or indexes such as S and P 500, you can see that Bitcoin's gains have almost tripled this year alone.　　
Why?　　
This is the most important factor: 　　
Pandemic flu panic-unemployment rate is rolling, social distance affects the uncertainty of the industry's long-term prospects, and fiat currency inflation concerns, investors are eager for commodities that can help store value.　　
Institutional interest-Alt-coins, especially Bitcoin, began to be of interest to major institutions. The most notable is Tesla's purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, which was jointly established with Vantone Financial Group to commend the investment of $100 million.　　
Payment methods-Many leading companies have begun to accept payments in crypto, including Starbucks, PayPal, and Etsy. This is widely used in the retail industry to actively promote circulation and affect prices.

Both can help you identify movements driven by asset valuation factors. This type of data can help your team track whether social indicators indicate bullish or bearish sentiment, and inform buy/sell/hold decisions. For example, if you are collecting social mentions of Etherium on a given whale account, on average you see some 20 mentions of coins every day. On a certain day, you may mention the 30th pick-up or a 50% surge in whale interest, achieving an increase in Etherium's valuation. Once these are established, "social signals" can help trigger a buy/sell order before any major migration (whether it is a buy or sell).

One can also collect other data sets with these estimates and create deductive models of changes. For example, suppose you are collecting data on the value of bitcoins and you realize that the price has increased to 44,200 dollars. The fact that you can collect news data points at the same time will result in a $1.5 billion investment in many of your works about Tesla in such assets. This may cause your analysts to set up trigger trading models based on the purchase of alt-coins by large institutional investors or corporate entities.

Alt data set according to your unique investment style
The collection you choose can really depend on your investment style. Most investment companies know that finding their own unique strategy is to place funds in any given landscape. Examples of alt data points, "unconventionally" might include:
　　
Mining data, mining coins based on Bitcoin and other blockchain coins, and transaction records. Nothing too complicated, these actions leave the digital footprint and can be used as alt to collect data. For example, Bitcoin is equivalent to point-of-sale data collecting data on new "blocks" added to the public record of the blockchain, indicating a transaction. This may also include the function of the crawling node as a public account, which will help verify transactions in the future. Tracking transactions can help show volume, coin demand, and circulation impact when you make a transaction.
　　
Cryptocurrencies among consumers have also become popular, and investors will have many fields in which data collection will play a vital role.　　
An example of this is that certain central banks, especially in the United States, may try to implement financial legislation and regulations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen is now focusing on encryption supervision-and real-time updates of legislative alt data will only have a key digital currency trader's needs in this regard.
